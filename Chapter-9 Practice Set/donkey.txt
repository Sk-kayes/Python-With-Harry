In a meadow green, a #### grazes,
With gentle eyes and soft, gray faces.
The #### walks through fields so wide,
With quiet grace, it takes each stride.

Oh, #### of the morning light,
You carry burdens, day and night.
A humble ####, steadfast and true,
In work and toil, you always pursue.

The #### brays a gentle song,
In fields where it has worked so long.
A loyal friend in times of need,
The ####'s heart is kind indeed.

Through mountains high and valleys low,
The ####'s path is sure to go.
A symbol of patience, strength, and care,
The ####'s spirit is everywhere.

So let us sing for the ####'s way,
For in its quiet life, it does convey,
A lesson of persistence and peace,
In the ####'s world, worries cease.

For the ####, simple and wise,
Sees beauty in the everyday skies.
With every step, a story unfolds,
In the life of a ####, true and bold.
