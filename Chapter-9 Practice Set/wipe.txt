In a quiet village nestled between mountains, lived an old man named Elias. He had a small garden where he grew rare flowers. One day, a young girl named Lily visited, drawn by the vibrant colors. Elias taught her about each bloom's unique story, sharing his wisdom and the joy of nurturing life. As seasons passed, Lily's visits became frequent, and the garden flourished under their care. Years later, Elias passed away, leaving Lily a note: "The garden is yours now. Share its beauty with the world." Lily continued his legacy, ensuring the garden's colors spread joy to all.
